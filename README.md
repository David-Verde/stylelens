**StyleLens is a powerful VS Code extension that acts as a co-pilot for your styles. It scans your entire frontend project to detect, visualize, and refactor duplicated, dead, or inline styles, helping you write cleaner, more consistent, and highly maintainable CSS.**

Whether you use **Tailwind CSS**, **pure CSS**, or **inline styles**, StyleLens streamlines your workflow and keeps your codebase pristine.

### üî• New in v1.0.0: The Complete Style Auditor

This major update transforms StyleLens into an essential tool for any modern frontend developer:

-   **Cross-File Duplicate Detection:** Finds identical style patterns (both `className` and inline `style` attributes) across your entire workspace, no matter the file or framework.
-   **Dead-Class Detection:** Scans your project for custom CSS classes used in your components (JSX, Vue, etc.) but **not defined** in any of your stylesheets. Eliminate ghost classes with confidence.
-   **Inline Style Refactoring:** A brand-new feature that detects repeated inline `style` blocks and helps you extract them into reusable CSS classes in one click.
-   **Smart Style Creation Engine:**
    -   For any "dead class," instantly generate a CSS rule.
    -   Choose between creating an empty rule (**Manual Mode**) or scaffolding it with a pre-built template (**Template Mode**).
    -   Templates are available in both **Tailwind CSS (`@apply`)** and **Pure CSS** formats, making the tool framework-agnostic.

### Why StyleLens?

In modern component-based projects, it's easy to fall into common traps:

-   **Inconsistency:** The same combination of Tailwind utilities (`flex items-center...`) or inline styles (`style={{ color: 'red' }}`) is repeated in dozens of places. A small design change becomes a project-wide scavenger hunt.
-   **Maintenance Nightmares:** Is this custom class `.user-avatar` still used anywhere? Is it safe to delete?
-   **Code Bloat:** Long, unreadable `className` attributes and forgotten, unused CSS rules make your markup and stylesheets difficult to navigate.

StyleLens solves these problems by providing a centralized dashboard and actionable insights, turning style maintenance from a chore into a quick, satisfying task.

### üöÄ Key Features

-   **Universal Style Analysis:** Works seamlessly with **React (JSX/TSX)** and **Vue**. (Svelte support is in development).
-   **Intelligent Dashboard:**
    -   Get a global overview of all **Duplicate `className` combinations**.
    -   See all **Duplicate Inline Styles**.
    -   Instantly spot **Undefined (Dead) Classes**.
-   **One-Click Refactoring & Creation:**
    -   **Consolidate Duplicates:** Extract repeated styles (both utility classes and inline styles) into a new, single CSS class and replace all occurrences across the project.
    -   **Generate Dead Classes:** Choose a "dead class," and let StyleLens create the CSS rule for you in your global stylesheet, either empty or pre-filled from a template.
-   **Framework-Agnostic Templates:**
    -   Scaffold common UI patterns like Cards, Buttons, and Inputs.
    -   Choose to generate them with Tailwind's `@apply` directive or with standard CSS properties.
-   **Quick Navigation:** Click any result in the panel to jump directly to the line of code in the corresponding file.
